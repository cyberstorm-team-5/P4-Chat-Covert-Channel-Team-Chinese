## About
This repository contains the code and other resources used for the foruth programming assignment, Chat Covert Channel. The Python code will extract a covert message based on delays between characters of a chat server's transmitted message. It outputs the overt message as it is received and automatically disconnects from the server once it is complete, displaying the covert message in stdout as well.
